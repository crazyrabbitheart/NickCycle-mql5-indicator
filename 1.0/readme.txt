MT5 Indicator Needed

Hi,
I need an indicator that will trigger buy or sell arrows depending on rules.
Indicator will only trigger when price meets a manually drawn trend line or S&R area.
Indicator will only trigger at certain times of the day.
Indicator will only trigger when the price closes within a certain pip range of S&R/Trend Line

Once the programmer is chosen I will send more detailed info on buy and sell conditions.

The programmer must have the ability to turn this into an EA later on, (in a separate project)
If you can't build an EA for trading, then please don't bid.
*** If you have pine script coding experience for Trading View that would be a bonus.***
As I will be looking to turn the MT5 Indicator into a Trading View script later. (Separate Project)

Thanks
Nick
